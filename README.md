# DAOstar: DAO Standards

![MIT License](https://img.shields.io/badge/license-MIT-blue.svg)

## Introduction

DAOstar is an initiative focused on creating and maintaining standards for Decentralized Autonomous Organizations (DAOs). This repository hosts the website for [daostar.org](https://daostar.org), as well as reference implementations, schemas, and other assets related to DAO standards, including but not limited to EIP-4824: Common Interfaces for DAOs.

DAOstar aims to provide a unified framework for DAOs, making it easier for organizations to adopt and implement standards that ensure interoperability, security, and ease of use.

The project is maintained by [DAOstar One](https://daostar.one) with support from [Metagov](https://metagov.org).

## Project Overview

DAOstar's primary objective is to develop and maintain standards for DAOs, helping to foster a more interoperable and secure ecosystem. This repository includes:

- **Schemas and Reference Implementations**: Standards and code to help DAOs adopt common practices.
- **DAO Improvement Proposals (DAOIPs)**: Contributions to evolving the DAO ecosystem.
- **Website**: Source code for [daostar.org](https://daostar.org).
